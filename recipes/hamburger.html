        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
            <li>0.5 cup crushed Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill or skillet to 350-400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>
                Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in all ingredients. Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth, 
                but stop once the mixture looks even.
            </li>
            <li>Divide mixture into 6 even portions. Pressing it flat into the bowl and using a knife may make this easier.</li>
            <li>
                Press these portion into patty shapes slightly larger than the buns you're using are to account for shrinkage.
                To avoid the middle puffing up you can use a spoon or your thumb to press a dent into the middle of each patty.
            </li>
            <li>Grill or fry patties for 3-4 minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>Stack burgers on buns and add the toppings of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
